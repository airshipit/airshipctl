Retrieves kubeconfig of the cluster and prints it to stdout.

If you specify clusterName, kubeconfig will have a CurrentContext set to clusterName and
will have its context defined.

If you don't specify clusterName, kubeconfig will have multiple contexts for every cluster
in the airship site. Context names will correspond to cluster names. CurrentContext will be empty.

Usage:
  get-kubeconfig CLUSTER_NAME [flags]

Examples:

Retrieve target-cluster kubeconfig
# airshipctl cluster get-kubeconfig target-cluster

Retrieve kubeconfig for the entire site; the kubeconfig will have context for every cluster
# airshipctl cluster get-kubeconfig


Flags:
  -h, --help   help for get-kubeconfig
