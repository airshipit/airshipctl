# These rules inject networking info into the k8scontrol function.
# Note! They are applied to Cluster object(s) regardless of name, so
# that they can be defined/used generically.  If more than one Cluster
# needs to be submitted to a management cluster, these tranformation
# rules should be applied to each Cluster in isolation, and then
# the results "mixed together" via kustomize.
