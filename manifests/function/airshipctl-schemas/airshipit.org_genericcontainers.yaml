                  statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example,
                  if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would
                  take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers
                  to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no
                  container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                  index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined
                  way of referencing a part of an object. TODO: this design is not
